# Test Sketch

This is a simple test sketch that logs information about the onboard LED state.

The Makefile relies on the availability of the [arduino-cli](https://github.com/jfcarr-hardware/arduino-cli) tool, but you can also easily compile the sketch with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
